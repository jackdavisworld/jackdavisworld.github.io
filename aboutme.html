<h1>STATEMENT</h1>
	<p>
I am an artist, designer, and writer, but mostly I am an iterator. Each piece I create seeks to further, reconsider, or challenge the conceptual assertion of a prior work. This process defines my creative identity more than any one concept or medium.

In the technical sense, I converse between the analog and the digital, the two- and the three-dimensional, the physical and the intangible. Artistically, I create through apparel design, mixed-media collage, graphic design, and drawing. Verbally, I write rhetorical analysis, personal narrative, and artistic criticism. Much of my work amalgamates multiple methods of making into one distinct process, such as my recent fashion sketch/poem hybrids collaged from tabloids.

Conceptually, I find inspiration in a diversity of academia: literature, history, physics, psychology, and more. I often explore themes that transcend the confines of one such discipline, such as oscillatory (harmonic) motion, psychosexuality, and linguistic theory. For example, in 2015 I created a series of psyche self-portraits employing the primary color triad to symbolize the id/ego/superego. I furthered the concept rhetorically in an essay comparing Gustave Flaubert to his character Emma Bovary along the thread of Freudian oral fixation.

Today, my primary theoretical considerations include the nebulous boundaries of the personal and the political, in particular contemporary conventions of gender and sexuality. My technical focuses are digital drawing, laser-cutting, and illustration. In a short essay (“The Boy in the Tulle Skirt”), I probed and rebuked the notion of “cross-dressing” as a separate identity. In the visual realm, I laser-etched a Korean beauty mask into acrylic (Mask) to immortalize a supposed instrument of gender-oriented insecurity. In the future, I hope to further explore contemporary gender theory in regard to the Maenads of the Euripidean Bacchae.

I aspire to unite my rhetorical and artistic interests in pursuit of social equity, ideally through the platform of editorial/artistic direction for a magazine or website.
